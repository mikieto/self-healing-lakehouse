-- ================================================
-- [CODE PILLAR] Reproducible Data Standardization
-- ================================================
-- Purpose: Transform raw sensor data into standardized, consistent format
-- Benefit: Same code always produces same result - eliminates manual intervention
-- Three Pillars Role: Foundation for reliable, reproducible automation
-- Learning Value: Demonstrates declarative data transformation principles

-- Code pillar principle: Explicit data validation at source
where 
    sensor_id is not null
    and measured_at is not null
    -- Basic sanity checks to ensure data quality
    and temperature is not null
    and humidity is not null
