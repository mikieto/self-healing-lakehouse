    -- ===============================================
-- [CODE PILLAR] Business Logic Implementation
-- ===============================================
-- Purpose: Implement consistent business rules and calculations
-- Benefit: Reproducible business logic that never changes between runs
-- Three Pillars Role: Ensures business rules are applied consistently
-- Learning Value: Shows how Code pillar enforces business consistency
