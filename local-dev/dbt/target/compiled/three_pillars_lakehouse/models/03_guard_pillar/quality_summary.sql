-- [GUARD PILLAR] Quality Monitoring Dashboard
-- ===============================================
-- Purpose: Provide real-time quality metrics for system protection monitoring
-- Benefit: Immediate visibility into data protection effectiveness
-- Three Pillars Role: Quality metrics for continuous system improvement
-- Learning Value: Shows how Guard pillar provides quality transparency
